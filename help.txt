Usage:  convert [-b BASE] [-r START FINISH]
	1 < BASE < 37
	START and FINISH are long integers

Options:
    -b BASE               Specifies the base for conversion.\n");
                          BASE must be an integer between 2 and 36.\n");
    -r START FINISH       Specifies the range of long integers to convert.\n");
                          START and FINISH are long integers defining the range (inclusive).

Examples:
    convert -b 16 -r 10 20
	Converts numbers from 10 to 20 into base 16 and displays the results.

    convert -b 8 -r 5 10
	Converts numbers from 5 to 10 into base 8 and displays the results.

Notes:
    - The base must be between 2 and 36 to support numeric and alphabetic characters.
    - The range START to FINISH must be valid long integers.
    - If incorrect arguments are provided, the program will show usage instructions.
    - If -b is not used, the conversion base will default to 16 (hexadecimal).
    - If -r is used, convert will output conversions for the given range of integers and then exit.
    - If -r is not used, convert will accept integers from standard input and convert them one at a time until it encounters an EOF character (ctrl-d). Then it will exit.
    - For bases higher than 10, capital letters A through Z should represent digit values 11 through 36.

Use this utility to easily convert a range of long integers to various bases.
